# EXP 5 - FREQUENCY REUSE

## Aim
To study and understand the concept of frequency reuse in cellular networks.

## Description
Frequency reuse allows the same frequency channels to be used in different cells,
separated by sufficient distance to avoid interference.

## Output
Simulation / diagram / calculation related to frequency reuse.

## Result
Thus, the frequency reuse concept was studied successfully.
