# EXP 8 - HIDDEN AND EXPOSED TERMINAL

## Aim
To study hidden and exposed terminal problems in wireless networks.

## Description
This experiment demonstrates the hidden and exposed terminal issues that occur in wireless networks.
It explains how collisions happen and ways to mitigate them using network protocols.

## Features / Observations
- Identify hidden terminal problem
- Identify exposed terminal problem
- Demonstrate collision scenarios
- Understand protocol solutions (e.g., RTS/CTS)

## Output
Clear understanding of hidden and exposed terminal problems with illustrative examples.

## Result
Thus, hidden and exposed terminal problems were analyzed successfully.
